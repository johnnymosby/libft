LIBFT
=====

Libft is a C library consisting of recreated functions mainly from standard libraries.

Includes functions to manipulate with:
1. Strings
2. Input / output
3. Type, type conversion
4. Lists
5. Memory allocation (calloc)

Plus, getline and simple printf.

### A remark for 42 students
The library is not conformant with the subject of "Libft" project. Namely, all the functions are compiled by default (no 'bonus' rule) and getline exists only in one version (able to read more than one file descriptor) and uses other libft functions.
